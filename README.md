# 🤖 Local AI Powered RAG System with PDF Ingestion using Ollama LlamaIndex ChromaDB and SQLite

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to process and query PDF documents using a combination of document ingestion, vector-based retrieval, and language model-based question answering. The system is built using **FastAPI** for the API, **Ollama** for embeddings and language model inference, **ChromaDB** for vector storage, and **SQLite** for chat history persistence.

## 🧭 System Overview

A modular, production-quality Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using:

- **Ollama** (local LLM + embeddings)
- **LlamaIndex** for document handling and querying
- **FastAPI** backend for integration
- **PyMuPDF** for PDF ingestion
- **ChromaDB** as the vector database
- **SQLite** for session management

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **PDF Ingestion**: Supports uploading and processing PDF files.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevents re-ingestion of the same files using file-level hashes.
- **Query Engine**: Answers user queries based on ingested documents.
- **Chat History Management**: Stores and retrieves chat sessions with session IDs.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📄 PDF ingestion with metadata (filename, page number)
- 🧠 Embedding with Ollama embeddings, stored in ChromaDB via LlamaIndex
- 🚫 Deduplication based on SHA256 hash of PDF text chunks
- 🔍 Retrieval of relevant document chunks with citations
- 💬 Session-based chat history stored in SQLite
- 🧹 Cleanup of unused sessions and storage
- 🚀 FastAPI API endpoints:
  - `POST /ingest` — Ingest a PDF file into the vector store
  - `POST /ask` — Query documents in a session with response + sources
  - `GET /history/{session_id}` — Retrieve chat history for a specific session
  - `GET /history` — Retrieve chat history across all sessions
  - `DELETE /history/{session_id}` — Delete all chat history for a session
  - `DELETE /cleanup-unused-sessions` — Remove unused session folders and DB records (with `dry_run` support)

## 🛠️ Setup

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download/windows)
   - Pull [nomic-embed-text](https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text)
      ```powershell
      ollama pull nomic-embed-text
      ```
   - Pull [deepseek-r1:1.5b](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:1.5b)
      ```powershell
      ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b
      ```
    ![Ollama model](readme-img/ollama-model-1.png)

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmad-act/Local-AI-Powered-RAG-System-with-PDF-Ingestion-using-Ollama-LlamaIndex-ChromaDB-and-SQLite.git
    cd Local-AI-Powered-RAG-System-with-PDF-Ingestion-using-Ollama-LlamaIndex-ChromaDB-and-SQLite
    ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Setup environment variables**

    Copy .env.example to .env and adjust as needed.

    Example .env:

    ```env
    EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
    QA_MODEL=deepseek-r1:1.5b
    OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
    CHROMA_DB=./chroma_db
    SESSION_DB=sqlite:///chat_history.db
    ```

### 🚀 Running the App

1. **Start Ollama Server**

   Run Ollama locally (ensure the server listens on the default port `11434`):

   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

    This starts the Ollama server accessible at:

    ```poweshell
    http://localhost:11434
    ```
2. **Verify Ollama is running**

   You can test with a simple curl request:

   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:11434/v1/models
   ```

   You should see the list of available models.

2. **Run FastAPI Server**

   ```bash
   uvicorn src.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
